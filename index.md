# Introduction

Multiprizer is a strategy-based game in which a player can choose from multiple gameboards of different gameplay, to play their tokens intelligently. The rounds are time-bound, hence after the timer runs out, one player is chosen using the most powerful ‘provable random’ in blockchain history - Ledger based random of Oraclize, with on-chain proof verification. The winner gets all the tokens played in that game round, after edge.

What makes Multiprizer unique is, it incorporates complete decentralization that blockchain and peer-to-peer networks imbibe, which means the games cannot be influenced by any entity and will run perpetually in the Blockchain based world computer.

It also implements the most secure and trust-less gameplay platform using best-in-class smart contract design methodology which cannot be tampered with or influenced by malicious players, rogue miners, hardware downtimes or Act of God.
