## Fairness of Gameplay implementing 'Undo' of token purchase
The game tokens, once purchased, can be undone by the **‘revert’ feature in which all the player's purchased tokens are cancelled, and the token value refunded to the player**. This is applicable at any point in time as long as the timer for that round has not expired.

The **games cannot be obstructed in any manner** while the round is still on. The game locks can only be implemented by admin on completion of game rounds, so does contract kill. Also, to maintain consistent win probability, new game boards are added instead of increasing total tokens for a specific game.
