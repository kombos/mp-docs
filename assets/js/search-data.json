    "content": "Features Most Powerful ‘Provable Random’ in Blockchain History Multiprizer uses the most sophisticated Provable Random Number to generate winner - Ledger based random of Oraclize, with on-chain proof verification. This makes compromising the ‘random’ by a malicious player or block miner practically impossible. Highest Level of Decentralization Achieved, making the games robust and tamper-proof his DApp is built with game parameters which make sure that the game cannot be controlled or manipulated by any party, not even the admin or creator of this game. The played tokens can be reverted by players if necessary, before the timer runs out. Play without visiting the site using ‘DirectPlay’ mode Players dont even have to visit the DApp site to play. One can send the token value of a specific game from their Ethereum Wallet to the Contract Address and the player participation gets auto-confirmed. Read More Emphasis on Strategy rather than ‘Random’ based outcome Games are designed such that there is a lot of leverage on how you play, rather than dependence on chance, to maximizes your outcome of victory. The per token probability itself is extremely low, teamed with option to purchase and revert at will, brings strategy as key to victory. Immaculately secure Smart Contract code The Smart Contract follows best-in-class SECUREDESIGN methodology which prevents attacks such as reentrancy, overflow/underflow etc. The contract is also publicly verified.
