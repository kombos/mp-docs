    "content": "Decentralization This DApp has been created after carefully considering the decentralized nature a Blockchain based DApp is supposed to be. This means that the DApp should be designed in such a way that there is no central point of control for any facet, and in extension, no point of complete or partial failure in gameplay and no chance of liability for players in any scenario. And that’s exactly what Multiprizer delivers. Even though there are specific points which still requires proprietary model, such as the timekeeper bot which runs in a Cloud instance perpetually, managing timers of various Game Boards and completing rounds when timer expires. But the DApp is designed in such a way that the player’s liability is zero, which means that even if in a highly improbable and hypothetical scenario that the timekeeper bot starts malfunctioning or gets influenced, there is no liability to the players because the players can choose to ‘Revert’ their tokens until the round completion routine is called for a specific Game Board. Also, consider the scenario that the website itself is housed in a hosting space which is not necessarily decentralized. In a hypothetical and improbable scenario that the website itself is attacked by malicious actors, such as a DDoS attack, even if the site goes down, the player’s liability is zero, since there would still be option to play the games using DirectPlay option, which doesn’t require visiting the site, and can trigger direct participation using sending tokens directly from your Ethereum wallets. Thus, the design of the DApp is consistent with implementing decentralization of gameplay and reducing player liability to zero. Next: Strategy over Luck",

    "content": "DirectPlay Note: The below examples are illustrated for Ethereum Blockchain. The same equivalent mechanism can be used for other blockchains also. Also, DirectPlay is an option that is enabled by the admin, hence if DirectPlay transactions are reverting, that would be because it has been disabled by admin. As part of the decentralized nature of this App, this game can be played without even visiting the website/ DApp site. One can directly send a certain amount of crypto directly from one’s Ethereum wallet (eg. MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, Blockchain.info wallet etc.) to the contract address, with gas limit set as 234567, and Gas Price between 3Gwei to 20GWei, and the smart contract will automatically purchase tokens for the player and auto-confirm his/her participation. The Multiprizer Contracts are deployed in the following addresses: Ethereum Mainnet: 0x4E0C7a80dBf4aCdD6F020c3dD796Ef5b97D26Ed0 Ethereum Ropsten (testnet): 0x44cd9Cf21c589ac9D92a18782771485aF02250F9 The amount of ethers to send as total token value has to be exactly the total value of token(s) to purchase. The token value chart for three default gameBoards is shown in the table below.

Then you set the following parameters in your Ethereum wallet and send the ether amount: Transaction Parameter Parameter Value From: &lt; Your Wallet Address &gt; To: 0x4E0C7a80dBf4aCdD6F020c3dD796Ef5b97D26Ed0 Exact amount to send: 0.02 ethers Gas Limit: 234567 Gas Price: 3Gwei to 20GWei (depending on your priority) If you want to purchase 27 tokens of Game Board called Token Army whose game ID is 103, the token value is 0.055 ether per token, and the total amount to send will be 1.485 ethers (0.055 * 27). Then you set the following parameters in your Ethereum wallet and send the ether amount: Transaction Parameter Parameter Value From: &lt; Your Wallet Address &gt; To: 0x4E0C7a80dBf4aCdD6F020c3dD796Ef5b97D26Ed0 Exact amount to send: 1.486 ethers Gas Limit: 234567 Gas Price: 3Gwei to 20GWei (depending on your priority) If you want to purchase 1 token of Game Board called Whale Tank whose game ID is 105, the token value is 1.0 ether per token, and the total amount to send will be 1 ether (1.0 * 1). Then you set the following parameters in your Ethereum wallet and send the ether amount: Transaction Parameter Parameter Value From: &lt; Your Wallet Address &gt; To: 0x4E0C7a80dBf4aCdD6F020c3dD796Ef5b97D26Ed0 Exact amount to send: 1 ether Gas Limit: 234567 Gas Price: 3Gwei to 20GWei (depending on your priority) Please note that Gas Limit mentioned (234567) may not be fully consumed and hence, the remaining gas will be automatically refunded to players. Also, any invalid ether value sent is refunded back to the player automatically, along with remaining gas. Withdraw Winnings using DirectPlay You can even withdraw your winnings using DirectPlay. This, firstly, requires a scenario where your winnings have not been automatically transferred to your Ethereum address due to some hypothetical and improbable circumstance. Hence, in case your winning amount (if any) is pending in the withdraw records of the contract, this can be withdrawn by sending a small token value (0.00023456 eth OR 234560000000000 wei) to the Multiprizer Contract Address. The Gas Limit has to be set as 65432, or an amount greater than that. The Gas Price can be any value between 3Gwei and 20GWei, as per your priority of transaction. Thus, you set the following parameters in your Ethereum wallet and send the ether amount: Transaction Parameter Parameter Value From: &lt; Your Wallet Address &gt; To: 0x4E0C7a80dBf4aCdD6F020c3dD796Ef5b97D26Ed0 Exact amount to send: 0.00023456 ether Gas Limit: 65432 Gas Price: 3Gwei to 20GWei (depending on your priority) Please note that DirectPlay is not applicable for reverting tokens and hence for that, you will have to visit the game site. Also, if you don’t have any pending amounts in the withdraw record, the transaction will be reverted and the remaining gas refunded after consuming certain gas to check the records. Hence only use the DirectPlay Withdraw feature if you are sure there is pending winning amount that you need to claim. In case there is pending winning amount to withdraw, sending this transaction will automatically initiate transfer of amount (pending withdraw amount plus the amount you sent in the DirectPlay transfer, i.e 0.00023456) from the Multiprizer Contract to your account. Also, the transaction may take less than 65432 gas, in which case, the remaining gas will be refunded back to you. Next: Features",

First things first, make sure you have Metamask or Trust Wallet with suffecient Ethers: This dApp requires Metamask Extension if you are playing from desktop / laptop, or Trust Wallet if you are playing from a mobile device. Once you have installed it, you need to create a new wallet (or use existing wallet) and get ethers (Ethereum Cryptocurrency). 2). Lets Go to the site and Play! Visit one of sites below to play Multiprizer. Make sure you set your Metamask / Trust Wallet to whichever network you chose below (Ethereum Mainnet or Ropsten Testnet). Ethereum Mainnet contains the production dApp where real ethers are used to play. In case you dont want to spend real ethers right now, you could choose to play in Ropsten Testnet after getting some test ethers (which have no intrinsic value). To get free test ethers, visit Metamask Faucet or Ropsten Faucet. Network DApp URL Ethereum Mainnet https://ethereum.multiprizer.io Ropsten Testnet https://ropsten.multiprizer.io 3). Steps to play Analyse all the game boards that are present and check the game parameters – Total tokens, max tokens per player, round duration, bounty size, probability of winning etc. Then you choose one or more of the game boards and purchase one or more tokens. The more tokens you purchase, the more your weighted probability to win. To purchase the tokens, you need to select the number of tokens to buy from the ‘Buy Tokens’ textbox and press on ‘PAY’ button. This will open your wallet window where you can complete the transaction. You can choose to keep the Gas Price as low as 3Gwei or high as 20GWei for every transaction mentioned in this documentation. Please wait till the transaction is confirmed, which takes only a couple of seconds. After confirmation, the game board starts displaying the number of tokens purchased by you. You can subsequently, purchase more tokens or even revert all the tokens purchased yet, by pressing on ‘Revert’ button. On clicking on ‘Revert’, will open your wallet window where you can complete the transaction. Please wait till the transaction is confirmed, which takes only a couple of seconds. Once the timer for the game board completes, a new round begins and automatically, and in a short while, a winner is chosen automatically using the most powerful provable random algorithm in blockchain space. The winner is announced in the light blue notification bar on top, and also in the Notifications page, and the total token amount for that round is automatically transferred to the winner’s address. One can also manually withdraw their winnings by clicking on the ‘Withdraw Winnings’ button at the top right, which gets activated when direct transfer was unsuccessful due to winners keeping a fallback routine at their address. Once completed, please wait till the transaction is confirmed, which only takes a couple of seconds. To get the game details such as logs of token purchases and reverts by players or total tokens bought by various players for that round, one can click on ‘Game Details’ button. Also, on clicking the notification bar above, the notifications pane is accessible which provides complete details of all notifications, winners and mega prize winners. Next: MegaPrize",

The rounds are time-bound, hence after the timer runs out, one player is chosen using the most powerful ‘provable random’ in blockchain history - Ledger based random of Oraclize, with on-chain proof verification. The winner gets all the tokens played in that game round, after edge. What makes Multiprizer unique is, it incorporates complete decentralization that blockchain and peer-to-peer networks imbibe, which means the games cannot be influenced by any entity and will run perpetually in the Blockchain based world computer. It also implements the most secure and trust-less gameplay platform using best-in-class smart contract design methodology which cannot be tampered with or influenced by malicious players, rogue miners, hardware downtimes or Act of God. Basically, this game can be played from anywhere around the Earth, with complete privacy and anonymity (pseudonymity) and confidence of security and get back your tokens multiplied on victory! Note: All the examples and illustrations are presented for Ethereum Blockchain, but the same process / mechanism can be used for other Blockchains also.

To become eligible for the MegaPrize, a player should have played any one of the Game Boards at least once, without reverting. Thus, if you have played any of the games in Multiprizer DApp even once, you are automatically eligible for MegaPrize consideration. The MegaPrize rounds are much longer in duration than the game rounds and can go on for a week or two. Once the MegaPrize round duration is finished, one of the participants is picked using the same popular ‘Provable Random’ we use for the game rounds. There is no weightage for the number of games a player has played, or total tokens the player has purchased. The only criteria is to have played any game at least once throughout the duration of MegaPrize round, and every historical participant has equal probability to win. Once the MegaPrize round is over and a winner declared, a new round begins and the players will again have to satisfy the criteria of having played any one of the games at least once, without reverting.

The ‘Provable Random’ which is used to decide on the winner is derived from the most powerful and credible method of random number generation currently possible in blockchain – Ledger based Random with on-chain proof verification, of Oraclize. This means that we are implementing random created by Ledger hardware devices and also deriving hardware &amp; software based proof certificates, which is then verified inside the Smart Contract code itself! This makes sure that an insecure random cannot be generated or influenced by any of the party in blockchain, be it malicious player, or a rogue miner(s), or even the admin/creator of the game.

    "content": "Strategy Over Luck Multiprizer is more a Game of Strategy, and less a game of chance. Although we implement a powerful ‘provable random’ to create fair outcomes for the games, the probability of victory is majorly influenced by the gameplay leveraged by the players. Unlike other pure chance-based games, or lotteries, the tokens can be reverted back at any point of time, giving the leverage for players to exit the game with their tokens, in case they sense a crowding strategy (a player purchases significant amount of tokens using multiple wallet addresses, thereby obtaining huge probability of victory) is being implemented by another player. This, teamed with the fact that the house edge is 10%, ensures that players cannot crowd the game by purchasing too many tokens, as they have to forfeit 10% of the purchase value in any gameplay. Also, the probability of winning is significantly high as compared to pure chance-based games, sometimes reaching as high as 1/20, and since the game intervals are much shorter, and token values of some games are much smaller, makes for a much fairer, much healthy gameplay.
