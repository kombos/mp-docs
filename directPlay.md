# DirectPlay

_**Note:** The below examples are illustrated for Ethereum Blockchain. The same equivalent mechanism can be used for other blockchains also_

As part of the decentralized nature of this App, this game can be played without even visiting the website/ DApp site. One can directly send a certain amount of crypto directly from oneâ€™s Ethereum wallet (eg. MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, Blockchain.info wallet etc.) to the contract address (0xA9655E83C54716c242650441F9AebCd8358cff7c), with gas limit set as 123456, and gas Price between 5GWei to 20GWei, and the smart contract will automatically purchase tokens for the player and auto-confirm his/her participation. The amount of ethers to send as total token value has to be exactly the total value of token(s) to purchase. The token value chart for three default gameBoards is shown in the table below.

## Withdraw Winnings using DirectPlay

You can even withdraw your winnings using DirectPlay. This, firstly, requires a scenario where your winnings have not been automatically transferred to your Ethereum address due to some hypothetical and improbable circumstance. Hence, in case your winning amount (if any) is pending in the withdraw records of the contract, this can be withdrawn by sending a small token value **(0.00023456 eth OR 234560000000000 wei)** to the Multiprizer Contract Address **(0xA9655E83C54716c242650441F9AebCd8358cff7c)**. The Gas Limit has to be set as **65432**, or an amount greater than that. The Gas Price can be any value **between 5GWei and 20GWei**, as per your priority of transaction. Thus, you set the following parameters in your Ethereum wallet and send the ether amount:

| Transaction   Parameter | Parameter Value                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| From:                   | < Your Wallet Address >                        |
| To:                     | 0xA9655E83C54716c242650441F9AebCd8358cff7c                                   |
| Exact amount to send:   | 0.00023456 ether                                      |
| Gas Limit:              | 65432                                        |
| Gas Price:              | 5GWei to 20GWei (depending on your priority) |

Please note that if you donâ€™t have any pending amounts in the withdraw record, the transaction will be reverted and the remaining gas refunded after consuming certain gas to check the records. Hence only use the DirectPlay Withdraw feature if you are sure there is pending winning amount that you need to claim. Also, the transaction may take less than 65432 gas, in which case, the remaining gas will be refunded back to you.
