# DirectPlay

As part of the decentralized nature of this App, this game can be played without even visiting the website/ DApp site. One can directly send a certain amount of crypto directly from oneâ€™s Ethereum wallet (eg. MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, Blockchain.info wallet etc.) to the contract address (0xblahblah) with gas limit set as 123456 and the smart contract will automatically purchase tokens for the player and auto-confirm his/her participation. The amount of crypo to send has to be exactly the total value of token(s) to purchase. The token value chart for the four default gameBoards is shown in the table below.
