# How To Play

•	Multiprizer is quite easy to play! You analyse all the game boards that are present and check the game parameters – Total tokens, max tokens per player, round duration, bounty size, probability of winning etc. Then you choose one or more of the game boards and purchase one or more tokens. The more tokens you purchase, the more your weighted probability to win.

•	To purchase the tokens, you need to select the number of tokens to buy from the ‘Buy Tokens’ textbox and press on ‘PAY’ button. This will open your wallet window where you can complete the transaction. You can choose to keep the Gas Price as low as 5GWei or high as 20GWei for every transaction mentioned in this documentation. Please wait till the transaction is confirmed, which takes only a couple of seconds.

•	After confirmation, the game board starts displaying the number of tokens purchased by you. You can subsequently, purchase more tokens or even revert all the tokens purchased yet, by pressing on ‘Revert’ button. On clicking on ‘Revert’, will open your wallet window where you can complete the transaction. Please wait till the transaction is confirmed, which takes only a couple of seconds.

•	Once the timer for the game board completes, a new round begins and automatically, and in a short while, a winner is chosen automatically using the most powerful provable random algorithm in blockchain space. The winner is announced in the light blue notification bar on top, and also in the Notifications page, and the total token amount for that round is automatically transferred to the winner’s address. 

•	One can also manually withdraw their winnings by clicking on the ‘Withdraw Winnings’ button at the top right, which gets activated when direct transfer was unsuccessful due to winners keeping a fallback routine at their address. Once completed, please wait till the transaction is confirmed, which only takes a couple of seconds.

•	To get the game details such as logs of token purchases and reverts by players or total tokens bought by various players for that round, one can click on ‘Game Details’ button. Also, on clicking the notification bar above, the notifications pane is accessible which provides complete details of all notifications, winners and mega prize winners.
